# Parcel
- Dev Build
- Local Server
- HMR- Hot module replacement.(Imdiate chaneges in the output as soon as you save it. Without even refresing the page.)
- Because parcel uses a File Watching Algorithm - which is written using C++.
- Parcel does caching in parcel-cache folder. - which makes faster builds.
